Thanks for visiting the front end repository of "Best in Show" "Petstagram", an api created by Sarah Saleh, Sara Laffin, Zach Friendly and Norman Calhoun as a project for our software imersion program at General Assembly Washington DC. This project utilizes Html, css, React, Javascript, Mongodb, Mongoose, Express, VS code, Jest automated testing, Storybook, Material UI, Github and Github workflow. In addition to data we have compiled either fictionally, and/or drawn from actual pets and owners, we have drawn data sets from https://www.kaggle.com/hocop1/cat-and-dog-breeds-parameters, for user reference enrichment. We are on schedule to deploy this project within the next few hours, and it will have full C.R.U.D., allowing it to take in user data on an ongoing basis.

<strong>What it does</strong>

This app is a scroll down display of our featured data, similar to Instagram. Data os displayed as a card with an image and selected information of each pet including a message. It has the capacity to accept 'likes' and take in this evolving data to set state. Upon user input the site will provide a new field with background information on the breed of the featured pet. Our featured data includes 50 cat breeds and 250 dog breeds, all with a unique infographic containing further data for the user experience.

<strong>Bronze, Silver and Gold strategies</strong>

Today's deployment will feature the above-mentioned aspects, but we hope to implement several enhanced features to increase the user experience. We hope to implement a feature that allows users to add comments to each of the data fields. We plan on providing a link to specific breed on post. We plan on adding a "date posted" feature to each card of data. We would like to add an 'unlike' feature. We plan on adding a feature that allows sorting by type, breed, likes and age. In addition, we hope to add a modal functionality feature.
